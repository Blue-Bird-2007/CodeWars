Problem
In this kata, you have to correctly return who is the "survivor", ie: the last element of a Josephus permutation.
Basically, you have to assume that n people are put into a circle and that they are eliminated in steps of k elements.

Python Code
def josephus_survivor(n,k):
    survivors = [i+1 for i in range(n)]
    remaining_survivors = survivors[:]
    number_of_survivors = len(remaining_survivors)
    jump = (k - 1) % number_of_survivors
    while number_of_survivors > 1:
      remaining_survivors.pop(jump)
      number_of_survivors -= 1
      jump = (jump + k - 1) % number_of_survivors
    return remaining_survivors[0]
